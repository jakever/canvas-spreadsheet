# events but only for the master branch

  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Install and Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        #uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.6.1
        run: npm run deploy
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          FOLDER: dist # The folder the action should deploy.
          CLEAN: true # Automatically remove deleted files from the deploy branch
